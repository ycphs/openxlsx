# openxlsx 4.2.5

## Fixes

* `openxlsx_setOp()` now works with named list ([#215](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/215))  
* `loadWorkbook()` imports `inlineStr`. Values remain `inlineStr` when writing the workbook with `saveWorkbook()`. Similar `read.xlsx` and `readWorkbook` import `inlineStr`.
* `read.xlsx()` no longer changes random seed ([#183](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/183))
* fixed a regression that caused fonts to be read in incorrectly ([#207](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/207))
* add option to save as read only recommended ([#201](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/201))
* fixed writing hyperlink formulas ([#200](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/200))
* `write.xlsx()` now throws an error if it doesn't have write permissions ([#190](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/190))
* `write.xlsx()` now again uses the default of `overwrite = TRUE` for saving files ([#249](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/249))

## Improvements

* `options()` are more consistently set in functions (see: [#289](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/262))
* `Workbook$show()` no longer fails when called in a 0 sheet workbook([#240](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/240))
* `read.xlsx()` again accepts `.xlsm` files ([#205](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/205),
[#209](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/209))
* `makeHyperlinkString()` does no longer require a sheet argument ([#57](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/57), [#58](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/58))
* improvements in how `openxlsx` creates temporary directories (see [#262](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/262))
* `writeData()` calls `force(x)` to evaluate the object before options are set ([#264](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/264))
* `createComment()` now correctly handles `integers` in `width` and `height` ([#275](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/275))
* `setStyles()` accepts `halign="justify"` ([#305](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/305))

# openxlsx 4.2.4

## Fixes

* `write.xlsx()` now successfully passes `withFilter` ([#151](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/151))
* code clean up PR [#168](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/pull/168)
* removal of unused variables PR [#168](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/pull/168)

## New features

* adds `buildWorkbook()` to generate a `Workbook` object from a (named) list or a data.frame ([#192](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/192), [#187](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/187))
  * this is now recommended rather than the `write.xlsx(x, file) ; wb <- read.xlsx(file)` functionality before
  * `write.xlsx()` is now a wrapper for `wb <- buildWorkbook(x); saveWorkbook(x, file)`
  * parameter checking from `write.xlsx()` >> `buildWorkbook()` are now held off until passed to `writeData()`, `writeDataTable()`, etc
  * `row.names` is now deprecated for `writeData()` and `writeDataTable()`; please use `rowNames` instead
* `read.xlsx()` now checks for the file extension `.xlsx`; previously it would throw an error when the file was `.xls` or `.xlm` files
* memory allocation improvements
* global options added for `minWidth` and `maxWidth`
* `write.xlsx()` >> `buildWorkbook()` can now handle `colWidths` passed as either a single element or a `list()`
* Added ability to change positioning of summary columns and rows.
  * These can be set with the `summaryCol` and `summaryRow` arguments in `pageSetup()`.
* `activeSheet` allows to set and get the active (displayed) sheet of a workbook.
* Adds new global options for workbook formatting ([#165](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/165); see `?op.openxlsx`)




# openxlsx 4.2.3

## New Features

* Most of functions in openxlsx now support non-ASCII arguments better. More specifically, we can use non-ASCII strings as names or contents for `createNamedRegion()` ([#103](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/103)), `writeComment()`, `writeData()`, `writeDataTable()` and `writeFormula()`. In addition, openxlsx now reads comments and region names that contain non-ASCII strings correctly on Windows. Thanks to @shrektan for the PR [#118](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/pull/118).

* `setColWidths()` now supports zero-length `cols`, which is convenient when `cols` is dynamically provided [#128](https://github.com/ycphs/openxlsx/issues/128). Thanks to @shrektan for the feature request and the PR.
